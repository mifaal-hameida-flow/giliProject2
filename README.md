 "This project was developed as part of my 10-unit Computer Science track in high school.
It is a simple web application built using Flask and Socket.IO, demonstrating real-time client–server communication.

The system allows the user to identify songs in a way similar to Shazam:
the device listens to a short audio sample, sends it to the server, and receives the matching song result.

Main Features

User Login System – users can sign in, and their details are saved.

Audio-Based Song Recognition – the app records audio, sends it to the server, and returns the identified song.

History Tracking – all past song recognitions are stored and can be viewed later.

Real-Time Communication – implemented using Flask-SocketIO to support quick data exchange between the client and server.

This project showcases server–client design, data management, audio processing flow, and basic real-time web communication."
